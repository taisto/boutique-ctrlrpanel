# boutique-ctrlrpanel#

## Introduction ##

My small project for creating Ctrlr panels for Roland Boutique JU-06
(and later also JX-03, since I own those two).
I know there is already a commercial offering for this.
However, the guy does not support / sell to Linux customers,
and I really like free software.

## Status ##

* 31.01.2017

	I have begun with the JU-06 panel and most CCs basicly work.
	Rest of the available CCs is still todo.

## TODOs ##

* (JU-06) Implement rest of available CCs.
* (JU-06) Try to use more buttons.
* (JU-06) Visual improvements.

## License ##

License of these panels is GPL v3.
